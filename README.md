# ZoharBetako
 A mexican restaurant serving me in a taco
 
Hola! This is my first android app! 
In order to understand the basics, I came up with a mexican restaurant whose theme is ME! 
At Zohar BeTaco you can find the highest quality of me served in a tortilla or a mojito! 

I created the app to practice writing a UI that would be responsive at all times. 
I used different types of widgets, a dialog, an animation chain containing 2 different animations, resource localization, etc.

Enjoy!
